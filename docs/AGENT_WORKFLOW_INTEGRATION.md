## GitHub Integration Workflows

### Issue Lifecycle Management

#### Canon Character Issues
```
1. Issue Created → Assigned to canon-content-archivist
2. Research Phase → Agent updates issue with progress
3. Content Complete → sports-stats-validator review requested
4. Validation Passed → character-image-generator assigned
5. Images Generated → card-game-designer creates card stats
6. Card Balanced → Issue closed, ready for Twin adaptation
```

#### Twin Character Issues  
```
1. Issue Created → Prerequisite check (Canon character complete)
2. Assigned to twin-character-generator → Adaptation design phase
3. Adaptation Complete → crossover-fusion-designer compatibility review
4. Compatibility Confirmed → character-image-generator creates Twin artwork
5. Images Generated → card-game-designer balances Twin card
6. Card Balanced → Issue closed, ready for potential fusion
```

#### Crossover Character Issues
```
1. Issue Created → Prerequisites check (Canon + Twin complete)
2. Assigned to crossover-fusion-designer → Fusion design phase  
3. Fusion Complete → card-game-designer legendary balance review
4. Balance Approved → character-image-generator creates fusion artwork
5. Images Generated → Community validation of fusion concept
6. Community Approved → Issue closed, legendary card ready
```

### Milestone Integration
