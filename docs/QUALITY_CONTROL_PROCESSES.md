**Pass Criteria**: Character adaptation feels authentic and adds meaningful variety to the multiverse

### Stage 5: Game Balance Validation
**Responsible Agent**: card-game-designer

**Balance Assessment**:
- [ ] Convert character data into balanced card statistics and costs
- [ ] Verify power levels appropriate for character tier (Canon/Twin/Crossover)
- [ ] Test technique balance against existing card pool
- [ ] Validate strategic diversity and meta-game health impact
- [ ] Confirm rarity assignment matches character importance and complexity

**Quality Gates**:
- Statistical balance verification against established power curves
- Playtesting validation with diverse deck archetypes
- Meta-game impact assessment for competitive health
- Strategic uniqueness confirmation

**Pass Criteria**: Character provides balanced strategic options without disrupting competitive play

### Stage 6: Visual Quality Validation
**Responsible Agent**: character-image-generator

**Visual Standards**:
- [ ] Generate character artwork meeting resolution and quality standards
- [ ] Ensure visual consistency with established art style and dimensional aesthetics
- [ ] Maintain character recognition while showing appropriate adaptation
- [ ] Create multiple format variants (portrait, card art, full body) as needed
- [ ] Validate community acceptance of visual representation

**Quality Gates**:
