- **Balanced Approaches**: Decks mixing both dimensional physics for versatility
- **Counter-Meta Options**: Use dimensional advantages to counter pure archetype builds

### Playtesting Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Nankatsu United (Tsubasa + Genzo)
**Expected Dynamics**:
- Tsubasa provides offensive pressure and team buffs
- Genzo establishes defensive stability and counter-attack potential
- Historic rivalry bonuses create powerful synergy effects
- High combined cost (15) requires efficient support package

**Testing Focus**: Balance between individual power and synergy benefits

#### Scenario 2: Camelot Mastery (Gawain + Lancelot)
**Expected Dynamics**:
- Gawain delivers explosive power attacks with scaling potential
- Lancelot provides precision control and technical superiority
- "Twin Peaks" synergy represents ultimate individual mastery combination
- Complementary stat profiles (Power vs Precision) create balanced coverage

**Testing Focus**: Individual excellence vs team coordination balance

#### Scenario 3: Cross-Dimensional Face-off
**Expected Dynamics**:
- Harmony overwhelming vs Focus precision creates fundamental tension
- Different optimal strategies force diverse deck building approaches
- Dimensional physics advantages/penalties create strategic depth
- Character-specific counters and synergies emerge through play

**Testing Focus**: Dimensional physics balance and cross-system interactions

### Playtesting Protocol

#### Phase 1: Individual Character Assessment (20 games each)
**Objectives**:
- Establish baseline power level for each character
- Identify dominant strategies and key weaknesses
- Test technique cost-to-effect ratios
- Evaluate stat distribution effectiveness

**Methodology**:
- Controlled environment with standardized opponent decks
- Track win rates, energy efficiency, and game length
- Document overpowered or underpowered techniques
- Note player skill expression opportunities

#### Phase 2: Archetype Definition (40 games total)
**Test Matchups**:
- Pure Harmony (Tsubasa focus) vs Pure Focus (Lancelot focus)
- Defensive Control (Genzo focus) vs Aggressive Power (Gawain focus)
- Mixed Synergy vs Pure Archetype builds
- High cost vs Low cost character strategies

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Competitive balance (45-55% win rate tolerance)
- Game length variation (avoid too fast or too slow games)
- Strategic depth (multiple viable play patterns)
- Skill differentiation (experienced players show advantage)

#### Phase 3: Meta Evolution (60 games total)
**Advanced Scenarios**:
- Counter-deck development and response
- Environmental card interactions
- Multi-character combination sequences
- Tournament setting simulation

**Long-term Concerns**:
- Character ban/restriction necessity
- Power creep potential with future expansions
- Skill ceiling accessibility for new players
- Competitive scene diversity

### Balance Monitoring Metrics

#### Statistical Tracking
- **Win Rate Distribution**: No character >60% or <40% in competitive play
- **Usage Rate**: Healthy representation across all four characters
- **Game Length**: Average 15-25 minutes, variance <50%
- **Energy Curve**: Smooth progression without dead turns or explosive dominance

#### Qualitative Assessment
- **Player Satisfaction**: Characters feel authentic to source material
- **Strategic Depth**: Multiple viable build paths per character
- **Learning Curve**: Accessible basics with high skill ceiling
- **Meta Health**: No single dominant strategy or oppressive combinations
